### Welcome, friends!
I'm Tony, the creator of this site.

In short, my mission for this site is simply to share ideas related to artificial intelligence. From the most basic and fundamental concepts to bleeding-edge research. I aim to keep the scope confined to AI-related topics, but hope that it stays broad enough so that visitors from all sorts of backgrounds can find something interesting.

I hope that those who happen to stop by here along their journey in AI discovery will leave with at least one extra bit of knowledge or information. I am by no means an expert in AI. I'm just a software developer with an M.S. in Computer Science, and a passion for AI. I love learning new things, and I enjoy sharing my new discoveries with others just as much.

Welcome to the site. I hope you enjoy your stay! 


### Let's being our journey with a cool image from NASA

Entitled "A Farewell to Saturn", this full mosaic of 42 wide-angle shots was taken from NASA's Cassini spacecraft. You can read more about it at the [NASA JPL site](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/images/pia17218-a-farewell-to-saturn).
